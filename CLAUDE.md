# Solana-web3js MCP Server Project Guide

This document serves as a reference for the Solana-web3js MCP server project development.

## Project Overview

The Solana-web3js MCP server enables AI assistants like Claude to build and deploy Solana smart contracts end-to-end through a standardized MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface. This server provides tools, resources, and prompt templates for interacting with the Solana blockchain.

## Development Commands

- `npm run build` - Build the TypeScript project
- `npm run start` - Start the server using stdio transport
- `npm run dev` - Start the server in development mode with auto-restart
- `npm run test` - Run test suite
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Git Workflow

- Default branch: `main`
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Fix branches: `fix/issue-description`
- Commit messages should be descriptive and follow the format:
  - `feat: Add new feature X`
  - `fix: Resolve issue with Y`
  - `docs: Update documentation for Z`
  - `refactor: Improve code structure for W`

## Project Structure

- `/src/index.ts` - Main entry point
- `/src/solana-server.ts` - Core server implementation
- `/src/core/` - Core functionality modules
- `/src/tools/` - MCP tool implementations
- `/src/resources/` - MCP resource implementations
- `/src/prompts/` - MCP prompt templates
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `/src/transport/` - Transport layer implementations

## Agent Orchestration Strategy

This project follows a specialized agent approach where the Project Manager (Claude) orchestrates multiple specialized agents working on different components of the system.

### Agent Types

1. **Architecture Agent** - Designs system components, interfaces, and flow
2. **Implementation Agent** - Writes code for specific modules and components
3. **Documentation Agent** - Creates user and developer documentation
4. **Testing Agent** - Creates test scenarios and test implementations
5. **Integration Agent** - Ensures components work together properly

### Agent Communication Guidelines

- Provide clear context about the project and component being worked on
- Include relevant code/files that impact the current task
- Specify detailed deliverables and success criteria
- Establish boundaries for decision making authority
- Provide guidance on coding style and project conventions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)
1. âœ… Set up project structure and configuration
2. âœ… Implement connection management module
3. âœ… Create basic server framework with transports
4. âœ… Develop error handling and logging

### Phase 2: Basic Tools (Completed)
1. âœ… Implement account management tools
2. âœ… Implement transaction operations tools
3. âœ… Implement key management tools
4. â¬œ Create basic resources and documentation

### Phase 3: Advanced Functionality (Completed)
1. âœ… Implement program deployment tools
2. âœ… Implement token operations tools
3. â¬œ Enhance resources with comprehensive documentation
4. â¬œ Develop advanced prompts for complex workflows

### Phase 4: Quality and Performance (In Progress)
1. ðŸ”„ Migrate codebase to Solana web3.js v2.0
   - âœ… Connection Manager migration
   - âœ… Key management tools migration
   - âœ… Program address tools migration
   - â¬œ Account management tools migration
   - â¬œ Transaction tools migration
   - â¬œ Program deployment tools migration
2. â¬œ Implement comprehensive test suite
3. â¬œ Add connection pooling and retry logic
4. â¬œ Optimize performance for high-throughput operations
5. â¬œ Add extensive logging and monitoring

## Web3.js v2.0 Migration

The project is currently migrating from web3.js v1.x to v2.0, which involves:

1. Switching from class-based APIs to functional programming patterns
2. Replacing Connection class with RPC client functions
3. Implementing new transaction message composition patterns
4. Updating cryptographic operations with native WebAssembly support
5. Enhancing type safety with improved TypeScript interfaces

Progress and next steps are tracked in `migration_plan.md` and `NEXT_STEPS.md`.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for MCP server functionality
- End-to-end tests for Solana operations
- Test coverage targets: 85% for critical components
