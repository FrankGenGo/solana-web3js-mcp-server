  - Token operations tools (Phase 3)
  - Web3.js v2.0 Migration (Substantial Progress)
    - Created migration branch
    - Updated dependencies
    - Migrated connection-manager.ts
    - Migrated key tools (generate.ts, import.ts)
    - Updated types/solana.ts
    - Migrated program address tools
    - Migrated account management tools
      - info.ts - Get account information
      - balance.ts - Check account balances
      - find.ts - Find program accounts
      - rent.ts - Calculate rent exemption
      - index.ts - Register account tools
    - Migrated transaction tools
      - create.ts - Transaction creation with message composition pattern
      - sign.ts - Transaction signing with new functional API
      - send.ts - Transaction sending with factory functions
      - status.ts - Transaction status checking with factory functions
      - simulate.ts - Transaction simulation with functional API
      - index.ts - Updated exports and tool registration

- **Current TypeScript Errors**: Remaining errors in files not yet migrated to web3.js v2.0
  - These errors are primarily related to compatibility with web3.js v2.0
  - Errors are being addressed file by file as we progress through the migration plan

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Continue Web3.js v2.0 Migration (Priority)

The migration has made substantial progress, with account management tools and transaction tools now fully migrated. Continue following the detailed migration plan in `migration_plan.md`:

1. **Complete Tool Migration in This Order**:
   - Program Tools (Next)
     - Update program deployment and upgrade logic
     - Migrate buffer utilities and loader utilities

2. **Update Transport Layer**:
   - Fix `/src/transport/stdio.ts` and `/src/transport/http.ts`
   - Update MCP communication code to support v2.0 patterns

3. **Update Entry Points**:
   - Fix `/src/index.ts` and `/src/solana-server.ts`
   - Update server initialization and registration logic

### 2. Implement Comprehensive Testing

1. **Set Up Testing Framework**
   - Configure Jest for TypeScript testing
   - Set up mock modules for Solana interactions

2. **Create Test Categories**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for MCP server functionality
   - End-to-end tests for Solana operations

3. **Implement Key Test Cases**
   - Core functionality tests
   - Tool operation tests
   - Error handling tests
   - Edge case tests

### 3. Resources and Documentation

1. **Create MCP Resources**:
   - Solana Concepts Documentation
   - Program Development Guide
   - Transaction Examples
   - Token Operation Examples

2. **Update API Documentation**:
   - Document all tools with example usage
   - Include parameter descriptions
   - Add response examples

### 4. Prompts Development

1. **Create MCP Prompts**:
   - Transaction Creation Guide
   - Program Deployment Walkthrough
   - Token Creation Guide
   - Conversational Blockchain Query Guide

## Extended Roadmap

### Phase 5: Extended Functionality (CLI Parity)

- **Configuration Management Tools**
  - Get and set configuration
  - Manage cluster connections
  - Store and retrieve user preferences

- **Enhanced Keypair Management**
  - Save keypairs to secure storage
  - Recover keypairs from seed phrases
  - Verify keypair integrity
  - Generate and display keypair information

- **Network Interaction Tools**
  - Request airdrops for testing environments
  - Manage stake accounts and delegation
  - Interact with validators
  - Vote account management

- **Transaction Utilities**
  - Decode transaction details
  - Confirm transaction status
  - Resend or retry failed transactions

- **Blockchain Data Inspection**
  - Block data retrieval and analysis
  - System health and version monitoring
  - Epoch and inflation information
  - Enhanced account queries and filtering

- **Logging & Monitoring**
  - Transaction and program log monitoring
  - Performance tracking and analysis

- **Comprehensive CLI Emulation**
  - Support all Solana CLI operations through MCP
  - Provide unified interface for CLI functionality

- **Natural Language Interaction**
  - Develop conversational interfaces to Solana operations
  - Create user-friendly explanations for errors
  - Implement guided blockchain exploration workflows

### Phase 6: CI/CD and Documentation

- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Complete comprehensive documentation
- Implement release management system

## Known Issues and Challenges

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Current TypeScript errors need to be resolved during migration
2. **Testing Coverage**: No comprehensive testing framework in place yet
3. **Documentation Gaps**: Need detailed API documentation and usage examples
4. **Versioning Strategy**: Need a clear versioning and release strategy
